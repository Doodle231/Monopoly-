# Monopoly-

# This is Monopoly in html, css, javascript. 


### features ### 

<p>This game has 3 computer players and one human controlled player. It has the ability to land on property and buy.  If a player doesn't decide to buy the property immediately, a seperate auction modal will popup. Other things such as build screen have been added for building houses. It's currently setup to only build houses and not hotels. I can consider adding those things later. </p>

# limitations #

<p> This is more or less a demo app. Obviously I cannot sell this game since I'm sure the Monopoly people wouldn't be too pleased. It's a tough thing because I don't want this project to seem unfinished, yet at the same time what really is the point in making a game that has already been made? This project is for learning and having fun. I tried to make a clear beginning and end point but when is an app ever really at a finished state? In any game I could find ways to add features. There is always room to improve upon someting </p>

<p> The CPU is very primitive. It probably cannot even be definied as a CPU. It has a few checks for property values and that is it. This is another case where it could be 
easy to be caried away and build out a very sophisticated CPU that has a game state set for every property piece. </p>

## possible bugs ## 

<p> I'm sure that several of the property cards aren't working properly. I started this project around two years ago. I have mix matched html and dynamic javascript intertwined and I just have a very simple working version. I should have just not tried to make any javascript generated cards and made them out of html. It would have solved a ton of headaches. Live and learn. I'm sure there is something glitchy with the player cash too. </p>

## Possible Ideas for the future ## 

####  A trade Screen #### 
<p> It's really hard to play a game without a proper trade screen. <p>



## Mobile Version ## 

<p> Some of the mobile features are slightly different. Most notably the small property cards are not shown within the player container. I just didn't think it would allow for a good experience so those things are hidden. Screenshots below </p>
